The project was a learning experience for our group and allowed us to improve our database design and SQL skills gradually over the past few months. Sports Shop Database provides an effective way for sports store managers and employees to easily process daily sales and manage the inventory and shipments. 

This system supports both in-store and online purchases. Customers can find the specific item quickly without any confusion as different items in database go under their own specific categories. Customers are able to use the store locator to find the store closest to their homes for convenience.
